As collaborators, we created executive dashboards for a Bike Store Company. Using SQL, we created a query to pick out order and sales info and create functions for revenue and total product. We then connected the SQL database to
Excel workbook where we created pivot tables and slicers to make the dashboard more interactive. We followed up our analytical skills by recreating the same dashboard on Tableau.
